A collection of tools for projecting a VR environment onto a physical model or displaying it on a screen.

## Installation

To add this package to your Unity project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the web URL of this repository. You can find this URL under the "Code" drop-down above, in the HTTPS tab. Alternatively, you can copy it directly here:
   https://github.com/boathungry/mr-projection-tools.git
2. Navigate to Unity and save your project if you have not done so already, as you may need to restart the editor as part of the installation process.
3. Open Unity's Package Manager. Open the "+" drop-down menu and select "Add package from git URL..."
4. Paste the URL you copied earlier into the text box that appears and click the "Add" button.
5. Unity should now install the package and its dependencies. You may be prompted to enable the native input backends for Unity's new input system. If so, select "Yes" and allow Unity to restart your editor to finish the installation.
